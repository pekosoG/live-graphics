# Live Graphics :sparkler:

This is my attempt to create some cool graphics in the browser and then use it to display them in a party or something like that.

> Actually, i just want to try it so I can create a nice wallpaper-ish

## But Why? :question:

Well, I saw [this Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ucTdeRcr0k) and i wantend to have something like that but a bit more... trippy :cyclone:

So I had an idea to merge the front-end animation and some way to _control_ it at will remotely

##  The Solution :bulb:

I want to have a JS (Probably React) Front-end what will be rendering an image/generated graphic, then, based on a listener, change it when the server say so.
